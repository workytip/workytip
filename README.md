# Hi, I'm Marwa Abdullah ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m a passionate Laravel backend developer with 2+ years of hands-on experience in database design, REST APIs, and scalable web applications. Iâ€™ve built management systems from scratch, and Iâ€™m expanding my skill set with DevOps practices as a current intern at DEPI. My goal is to become a senior Laravel developer, lead projects, and mentor junior talent. I love the Laravel ecosystem and enjoy bridging backend with modern frontend technologies like ReactJS.
